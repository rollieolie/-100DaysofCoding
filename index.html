            <p>I am goin to have to figure out what I want on my website!!</p>
                <p>Maybe I will start to make a list</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>I want it to have links to webapp pentesting</li>
                    <li>I want to have some cool designed pictures</li>
                    <li>I need to learn some css to make it pop</li>
                    <li>I want to have some links to go to resources other people can use</li>
                    <li>I want to make some javascript to do cool things</li>
                    
                </ol>

                <a href="https://www.google.com">Go look some stuff up!!</a>
    
    
    
            <p>I have no idea what else to start coding. I added an alert in JS because all I know how to do right now is make alerts and prompts. Everything else I know how to do is sent to the console.</p>

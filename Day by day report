Day 1 - 05/14/20
Today I am starting off with free code camp to start learning all the basics of other languages. I am also working on a Udemy class that teaches Javascript.
My goal learning coding is to be able to understand the source code behind web apps so I can hunt for bugs in bugbounties. The extra perk would be
how to create a decent looking website or app. I still need to figure out a project to work on during these 100 days.

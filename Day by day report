Day 1 - 05/14/20
Today I am starting off with free code camp to start learning all the basics of other languages. I am also working on a Udemy class that teaches Javascript.
My goal learning coding is to be able to understand the source code behind web apps so I can hunt for bugs in bugbounties. The extra perk would be
how to create a decent looking website or app. I still need to figure out a project to work on during these 100 days.

-I started with free code camp and got 86% though the Basic HTML and HTML5 level. I found it to be really neat. You get to code and see what you're codding in real time.
After I was finished with that I started on my website. I started an outline and wrote on the webpage what I wanted to do.


-Day 2 - 05/14/20
Today I hoped right into Free code camp and finished off the Basic HTML and started on beginners CSS. I am having a lot of fun with this website.
I kind of already new about the HTML but I have never touched css and I am having fun learning it.
I worked on my website alittle bit more. I created a rough layout of some of the stuff I want on paint and posted it to the repo.
I then sit down and did my hour of coding. It really does not look like a hour of coding but figuring out how some stuff works like the color of
the background and the color for text took me a second to reflect. The most frustrating thing so far is having no idea what I want a finished
site to be and I am scared I won't be able to pull off everything I want.
